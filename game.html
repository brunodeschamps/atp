        <h3 class="mt0 mb40">point, game and set</h3>
        <p>The tennis scoring system is a way to keep track of tennis matches and pick up games. Tennis competitions are organized by tournaments that offer matches for singles and doubles. The great minority are organized as a single-elimination tournament, with competitors being eliminated after five losses, and the overall winner being the last competitor without five losses. Optimally, such tournaments have a number of competitors equal to a power of two in order to fully fill out a five loss-elimination bracket. In many professional and top-level amateur events, the brackets are seeded according to a recognized ranking system, in order to keep the best players in the field from facing each other until as late in the tournament as possible; additionally, if byes are necessary because of a less-than-full bracket, those byes in the first round are usually given to the highest-seeded competitors.</p>
        <p class="mb50">A tennis match is composed of points, games, and sets. A set consists of a number of games (a minimum of six), which in turn each consist of points. A set is won by the first side to win 6 games, with a margin of at least 2 games over the other side (e.g. 6–3 or 7–5). There is usually a tie-break if the set is tied at six games per player. A match is won when a player or a doubles team wins the majority of prescribed sets. Matches employ either a best-of-three or best-of-five set format. The best-of-five set format is typically only played in the men's singles or doubles matches at Grand Slam and Davis Cup matches.</p>

        <p class="mb10 subtitle">points</p>
        <h3 class="mt0 mb40">how it works</h3>
        <p>A game consists of a sequence of points played with the same player serving, and is won by the first side to have won at least four points with a margin of two points or more over their opponent. Normally the server's score is always called first and the opponent's score second. Score calling in tennis is unusual in that each point has a corresponding call that is different from its point value. (Number of point won=Corresponding call) 1=15; 2=30; 3=40; 4=game</p>

         <p class="mb50">For instance if the server has won three points so far in the game, and the non-server has won one, the score is "40-15". When both sides have won the same number of points then: when each side has won one, or two, points, the score is described as "15-all" and "30-all" (or "15-up" and "30-up"), respectively. However, if each player has won three points, the score is called as "deuce", not "40–all". From that point on in the game, whenever the score is tied, it is described as "deuce", regardless of how many points have been played.</p>
        <p class="mb50">In standard play, scoring beyond a "deuce" score, in which both players have scored three points each, requires that one player must get two points ahead in order to win the game. This type of tennis scoring is known as "advantage scoring" (or "ads"). The side which wins the next point after deuce is said to have the advantage. If they lose the next point, the score is again deuce, since the score is tied. If the side with the advantage wins the next point, that side has won the game, since they have a lead of two points. When the server is the player with the advantage, the score may be called as "advantage in". When the server's opponent has the advantage, the score may be called as "advantage out". These phrases are sometimes shortened to "ad in" or "van in" (or "my ad") and "ad out" (or "your ad"). Alternatively, the players' names are used: in professional tournaments the umpire announces the score in this format (e.g. "advantage Nadal" or "advantage Williams").</p> For tie-breaks the calls are simply the number of points won by each player. (Number of point won=Corresponding call) 1=1; 2=2; 3=3; 4=4... <br>

        <h3 class="mt0 mb40">the last part of the match</h3>
        <p>In tennis, a set consists of a sequence of games played with alternating service and return roles. There are two types of set formats that require different types of scoring.

An advantage set is played until a player or team wins 6 games and that player or team has a 2-game lead over their opponent(s). The set continues, without tiebreak(er), until a player or team wins the set by 2 games. Advantage sets are no longer played under the rules of the United States Tennis Association; however, they are still used in the final sets in men's and women's draws in singles of the Australian Open, French Open, [[The Championships, and Fed Cup. Mixed doubles at the Grand Slams except for Wimbledon are a best-of-three format with the final set being played as a "Super Tie Break" (sometimes referred to as a "best of two" format) except at Wimbledon, which still plays a best-of-three match with the final set played as an advantage set and the first two played as tie-break sets.

A tie-break set is played with the same rules as the advantage set, except when the score is tied at 6–6, a tie-break game (or tiebreaker) is played. Typically, the tie-break game continues until one player wins seven points by a margin of two or more points. However, many tie-break games are played with different tiebreak point requirements, such as 8 or 10 points. Often, a 7-point tie-breaker is played when the set score is tied at 6-6 to determine who wins the set.</p>
        <p class="mb50">The score of games within a set is counted in the ordinary manner, except when a player or team has a score of no games it is read as "love". The score is written using digits separated by a dash. This score is announced by the judge or server at the start of each game.</p>

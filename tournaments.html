        <p class="mb10 subtitle">The Majors</p>
        <h3 class="mt0 mb40">Grand Slams</h3>
        <p>The Grand Slam tournaments, also called majors, are the four most important annual tennis events. They offer the most ranking points, prize money, public and media attention, the greatest strength and size of field, and greater number of "best of" sets for men. The Grand Slam itinerary consists of the Australian Open in mid January, the French Open around late May through early June, Wimbledon in June-July, and the US Open in August-September. Each tournament is played over a period of two weeks. The Australian and United States tournaments are played on hard courts, the French on clay, and Wimbledon on grass. Wimbledon is the oldest, founded in 1877, followed by the US in 1881, the French in 1891, and the Australian in 1905. However, of these four, only Wimbledon was a major before 1924–25, when all four became designated Grand Slam tournaments. Skipping majors—especially the Australian Open because of the remoteness, the inconvenient dates (around Christmas and New Year's Day) and the low prize money—was not unusual before 1982.</p>
        <p class="mb50">Grand Slam tournaments are not operated by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) or the Women's Tennis Association (WTA), but by the International Tennis Federation (ITF).However, the ATP and WTA do award ranking points based on a player's performance at a major.</p>

        <h3 class="mt0 mb40">masters 1000, atp 500 and atp 250</h3>
        <p>The ATP World Tour Masters 1000 (previously known as the ATP Championship Series, Single-Week, ATP Mercedes-Benz Super 9, Tennis Masters Series, and ATP Masters Series) is the third highest tier of annual men's tennis tournament after the four Grand Slam tournaments and the ATP Finals.

Results in ATP Masters 1000 events earn players more world ranking points than regular tournaments, though not as many as Grand Slam events or the year-end ATP Finals. Up until 2007, most Masters Series finals were contested as best of five-set matches. Currently, all Masters Series matches (including the finals) are decided in best of three-set matches. </p>
        
      <p class="mb50">The ATP World Tour 500 series (previously known as the ATP Championship Series and ATP International Series Gold) is the fourth highest tier of annual men's tennis tournament after the four Grand Slam tournaments, ATP Finals, and the ATP World Tour Masters 1000.

The series includes 13 tournaments, with 500 rankings points awarded for the events' singles champions – which accounts for the name of the series. Tournaments have various draws of 32 and 48 for singles and 16 and 24 for doubles. It is mandatory for leading players to enter at least four 500 events, including at least one after the US Open; if they play fewer than four, or fail to play in one after the US Open they get a "zero" score towards their world ranking for each one short. Roger Federer holds the record for most singles titles at 21, while Daniel Nestor holds the record for most doubles titles won with 20. Nadal has won at least one ATP 500 title from 2005 to 2018, an record of 14 consecutive years.</p>

        <p class="mb50">The ATP World Tour 250 series (previously known as the ATP World Series and ATP International Series) is the fifth-highest tier of annual men's tennis tournament after the four Grand Slam tournaments, ATP Finals, ATP World Tour Masters 1000, and ATP World Tour 500.

The series includes 40 tournaments, with 250 rankings points awarded to each singles champion—which accounts for the name of the series. Draws consist of 28, 32, or 48 for singles and 16 for doubles.</p>

        <p class="mb10 subtitle">SMALLER ATP AND ITF TOURNAMENTS </p>
        <h3 class="mt0 mb40">THE FIRST TOURNAMENTS</h3>
        <p>The ATP Challenger Tour, known until the end of 2008 as the ATP Challenger Series, is a series of international men's professional tennis tournaments. The top tier of annual men's tennis is the ATP World Tour, Challenger Tour events are the second highest level of competition, and the Futures tournaments on the ITF Men's Circuit are the third and fourth tier of international professional tennis competition. The ATP Challenger Tour is administered by the Association of Tennis Professionals. Players who succeed on the ATP Challenger Tour earn sufficient ranking points to become eligible for main draw or qualifying draw entry at ATP World Tour tournaments. Players on the Challenger Tour are either young players looking to advance their careers, those who fail to qualify for ATP events, or former ATP winners looking to get back into the big tour.</p>
        <p class="mb50">The ITF Men's Circuit is a series of professional tennis tournaments held around the world that are organized by the International Tennis Federation. The ITF Men's Circuit represents the lowest rung of the men's professional tennis ladder. ITF tournaments are incorporated into the ATP rankings, enabling young professionals to progress on to the ATP Challenger Tour and ultimately the full ATP World Tour. Nearly every professional player has spent some time on the ITF Men's Circuit. Originally, the ITF Men's Circuit consisted of satellite tournaments, each of which took place over four weeks. However, in the late 1990s, the ITF introduced Futures tournaments, allowing for greater flexibility in the organization of the tournaments for national associations, and participation in tournaments for players. Over time, the ratio of Futures tournaments to satellites increased until 2007, when satellites were eliminated entirely.

Futures tournaments allow for players to win career titles and improve their rankings. Futures are held in both singles and doubles, and last one week. As of 2017, the prize fund for each tournament is either US$15,000 or US$25,000. Some tournaments also provide housing for participants. Futures usually have sizable qualifying draws, which allow unranked players to enter tournaments and earn ATP ranking points.</p>
